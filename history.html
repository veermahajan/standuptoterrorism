	<h2>Introduction</h2>
	<p>The term “terrorism” is believed to have been first used to describe the Jacobins in power during the Reign of Terror of the French Revolution, when anybody suspected to be against the Revolutionary Government could become a victim in mass guillotine executions (“Introduction to International Terrorism”). Modern terrorism emerged in the 19th and 20th centuries as violence became gradually more indiscriminate and deadly, shaping it into what we know it as now. Today, terrorism is generally defined as the use of violence, often against innocent victims, to spread fear and thus coerce other parties in order to achieve political or ideological goals. However, the use of terrorism far predates its coinage, and is even considered by some to be “as old as government and armed struggle, and as pervasive” (“Introduction”). 
</p>
	<h2>Early and Developing Terrorism</h2>
	<p>In the 19th century, terrorism began to develop, with targeted assassination being the main goal of many groups dedicated to committing such violence. The use of these actions to achieve political goals was seen as justified or even honorable because these efforts spared innocent civilians. Many radicals advocated for the use of terrorism after other forms of propaganda failed to provoke rebellions against the government as they had hoped, and they instead looked to violence as a means to do so instead. Thus, they employed what came to be known as “propaganda by the deed,” whereby the act of terrorism would serve as a strong political message in and of itself. One major example of this that later inspired many other acts of violence is the successful assassination of Tsar Alexander II by the self-described Russian terrorist group Narodnaya Volya in 1881. Similarly, the 1914 assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria by Serbian nationalist Gavrilo Princip was also highly notable, being the event triggering the First World War. After the First World War, many states increasingly initiated cooperative efforts to defend themselves against terrorism. Many bilateral extradition treaties “contained clauses excluding assassination attempts against Heads of State from the exempted list of political offenses” (“Introduction”). However, many League of Nations conventions on terrorism during this time were eventually never enforced due to the outbreak of the Second World War and the ensuing collapse of the organization. </p>

	<h2>Modern Era</h2>
	<p>Today, in the era of the United Nations, many issues still arise concerning the conflict between the protection of international peace and the right of peoples’ self-determination. In many cases, it can be argued that the difference between a freedom fighter and a terrorist is simply a matter of perspective. Terrorist attacks today can encompass a wide range of methods and strategies, including but not limited to “bombings, arson, hostage-taking, hijacking, kidnapping, sabotage,” and so on (“Introduction”). Terrorism today is also highly associated with “conflict zones”, with over 98% of terrorist attacks in 2023 occurring in these areas (“Global Terrorism Index 2024”). Modern-day terrorism is also primarily focused on militant Islamic extremist groups such as al-Qaeda and the Islamic State. Most notably, the September 11 attacks brought terrorism to global attention while sparking domestic and international outrage, provoking the US-led War on Terror in response. However, domestic terrorism in the United States is also a growing problem, with hundreds of such incidents found in the past decade. In addition to anti-government terror acts, many of these crimes have also been racially or ethnically motivated, highlighting an issue the nation has struggled to grapple with for centuries. </p>
