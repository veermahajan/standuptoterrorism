    <h1>Current Event</h1>
    <img id="CEmainPic" src="map.png" alt="Map of Houthi control in the Red Sea.">
<div id="CEmain"><h2>Background</h2><p>Just recently, the United States Department of State announced that they would be designating the Houthi group (formally known as Ansarallah) a terrorist organization. The Houthis, operating from Yemen, are notorious for their attacks on both American and non-American naval vessels alike. These include numerous civilian ships being hijacked, alongside drone and missile attacks. To the right is a map (from the public domain) which shows their presence in the Red Sea just in the past few months of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. It also shows the extent of their attacks in the area through the mini-ship graphics.</p><br>
  <h2>America's Response</h2><p>In light of the humaniarian issue in Yemen due to the Houthi rule (and general division), the United States Government has provided humanitarian aid to Yemeni citizens, like "the provision of food, medicine, and fuel, as well as personal remittances, telecommunications and mail, and port and airport operations on which the Yemeni people rely" (Blinken) from the Department of Treasury. Furthermore, they have taken the decision to formally call the Houthis a terrorist group.</p>
  <p>The US Department of State said that "these attacks [of the Houthis] against international shipping have endangered mariners, disrupted the free flow of commerce, and interfered with navigational rights and freedoms.  This designation seeks to promote accountability for the groupâ€™s terrorist activities," (Blinken) which sheds light on the reason for this decision.</p><br><h2>Key Takeaways</h2>
  <p>This decision will now alert citizens that the situation is no joke, and also show how important it is to support the American government's actions against the Houthis. Without such a designation, many Americans would continue to believe that America is engaging the Houthis merely for selfish, money-oriented reasons, which is not true. Overall, this is just one event in a broader pattern of growing terror movements. With awareness being the first step to action, this designation is of absolute essence to the safety of America and other countries around the world.</p>
